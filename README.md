# NEPANodeBot

This is our bot. This bot will be our ongoing project. If you want to get involved, reachout to one of us! 

## Installation

To install the app: 

1. Clone the project from: `https://github.com/nepajs/nepanodebot.git`
2. In the project directory, install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

Until the app is hosted elsewhere, it needs to be run locally.

You will need the Slack API Key. It can be found in our slack team channel #botesting or by asking a contributor. 

To run the bot locally: `BOT_API_KEY=APIKEYHERE node nepanodebot.js`

With the bot running, you can now interact with it by using the keywords.
